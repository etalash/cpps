# 42 C++ Modules – CPP02 to CPP04

This repository contains my projects from the 42 C++ modules. Each project focuses on progressively learning object-oriented programming and C++ concepts.

## CPP02 – C++ Classes and Encapsulation

The second module builds upon CPP01 and focuses on **encapsulation and access modifiers**.

### Overview

`CPP02` teaches proper use of private, protected, and public members, and designing classes that maintain internal consistency.

### Features

* Implementation of private and public class members
* Constructors and destructors
* Getters and setters for safe data access
* Basic operator overloading

### Installation & Build

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cpp02
make
./<executable>
```

### Notes

* Focus on writing classes that respect encapsulation and data integrity.

## CPP03 – Inheritance and Polymorphism

The third module introduces **inheritance and polymorphism**.

### Overview

`CPP03` teaches how to design class hierarchies, use base and derived classes, and implement virtual functions for polymorphic behavior.

### Features

* Base and derived classes
* Virtual functions and overriding
* Polymorphism in action
* Dynamic memory management

### Installation & Build

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cpp03
make
./<executable>
```

### Notes

* Key focus on designing flexible and reusable class hierarchies.

## CPP04 – Advanced C++ Concepts

The fourth module covers **advanced C++ topics** including abstract classes, interfaces, and deep copy operations.

### Overview

`CPP04` challenges you to implement abstract base classes, manage resource ownership correctly, and understand copy semantics.

### Features

* Abstract classes and pure virtual functions
* Deep copy vs shallow copy
* Copy constructors and assignment operators
* Proper resource management

### Installation & Build

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cpp04
make
./<executable>
```

### Notes

* Prepares for larger C++ projects requiring safe memory handling and robust class design.
